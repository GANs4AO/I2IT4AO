What does it do.

-----------------------------------------------------------
%%%PSF Reconstruction Experimentation from trained model%%%
-----------------------------------------------------------
(available in this project - see unpacking instructions in the checkpoints folder for 'Direct Amplitude' Network)

+ Creating the Roket Buffers (ie. building a statistical model for the AO system)

+ Building a Long Exposure PSF from the pre-trained network 

+ Split code

+ Circular Average and Long Exposure PSF view


----------------------------------------------------------------------
%%%GAN Assisted Open Loop (GAOL) Experimentation from trained model%%%
----------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Just hit go on notebook!

+ Adjust parameters to get results from paper.
